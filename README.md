# Interpolation Methods Overview

This repository contains the fundamentals of interpolation methods. The notebook begins with an introduction to interpolation, introduces the Vandermonde matrix, delves into the Lagrange polynomial interpolation method, addresses Runge's phenomenon, explores segmented interpolation techniques like splines, and investigates Chebyshev nodes to explain their application in reducing interpolation error.

## Description

The notebook covers the following sections:

1. **Introduction**: An overview of the interpolation problem.
2. **Vandermonde**: Code using the Vandermonde matrix to polynomial interpolation.
3. **Lagrange Approach**: Presentation of the Lagrange polynomial interpolation method.
4. **Runge's Phenomenon**: Analysis of Runge's phenomenon.
5. **Piecewise Linear Interpolation**: Code for a piecewise linear interpolation.
6. **Chebyshev**: Code using Chebyshev points to reduce interpolation error and deal with Runge's phenomenon.
